Have you ever wondered how it feels when your carefully planned and exciting trip gets completely ruined by your own mistakes? Well, I was really sad, annoyed, and a bit regretful. That’s why I’m sharing my travel disasters in Japan — so you can avoid making the same ones!

## My Dreams
Have you ever dreamed of visiting Japan? I definitely have. During the National Holiday, I decided to finally go there to see its beautiful landmarks and enjoy its delicious food. The famous sushi and ramen had been on my must-try list for years. I was also eager to see the friendly deer that appear in so many travel videos. I had never even seen one in real life, so I imagined it would be magical.

## The Hit from Reality
With all these wonderful expectations, I arrived in Japan. I initially get to a local shop where I bought several sushi rolls. They tasted amazing — way better than the ones I’d eaten in Shanghai. But soon, my first problem appeared. After finishing the sushi, I couldn’t find a rubbish bin anywhere! In China, there are bins almost on every street corner, but after an hour of searching, I didn’t see a single one. I ended up keeping the container in my pocket, and the sauce leaked onto my clothes. It took another hour to clean up when I got back to the hotel.

To make matters worse, the next day, I went to a deer park to get a closer look at the animals. Everything was fine until I tried to feed the third deer — it bit my finger really hard! The pain was like a knife in your heart, and I got to go to a local hospital, where the treatment cost me nearly 1,000 yuan.

## The Lessons I Learned
From those obstacles, I learned two lessons. If you’re traveling in Japan, carry a small plastic bag in your pocket in case you can’t find a rubbish bin just like I did. Besides, be mild and gentle when feeding deer — they can suddenly become pretty aggressive if you scare them. At that moment when I face problems, I realized that traveling is not just about sightseeing — it’s about adapting to unexpected situation.

## Conclusion
This journey was deinitely disappointing, but it taught me a lot thorugh those problems I faced. When traveling abroad, it’s always the best to research local cultral backgrounds. That way, you can enjoy the trip — instead of staying regretful after years passed like I did! Great Lesson learned! Have you ever had a trip that went completely to the mistaken path?
